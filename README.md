# Vulnerability Assessment Report

This report is part of my Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate.

## Purpose

The purpose of this vulnerability assessment is to evaluate the security risks associated with the publicly accessible database server used by the company. The database server, which has been open to the public since the company's launch, stores valuable information that is critical to business operations. Securing the data on the server is essential to protect the company's assets and to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the information. If the server were compromised, it could significantly impact business operations and customer trust.

## System Description and Scope

**System Description:**
The system being evaluated is a remote database server that stores information critical to the company's operations. Employees query this database regularly to identify potential customers. The server has been publicly accessible since the company's launch.

**Scope:**
The scope of this assessment includes evaluating the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the data stored on the server. The physical security of the server and related IT systems is outside the scope of this assessment.

## Risk Assessment

| **Threat Source**        | **Threat Event**                               | **Likelihood** | **Severity** | **Risk** |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------|----------|
| External Attackers        | Unauthorized access to the database            | 3              | 3            | 9        |
| Insider Threat            | Data exfiltration by a malicious employee      | 2              | 3            | 6        |
| Human Error               | Accidental data deletion by an employee        | 2              | 2            | 4        |

## Approach

The threats identified were selected based on their potential impact on the business and the likelihood of occurrence. Unauthorized access by external attackers poses a significant risk due to the public accessibility of the server. Insider threats, while less likely, could lead to severe data breaches if an employee decides to act maliciously. Human error, though generally less severe, is still a concern given the critical nature of the data.

## Remediation

To mitigate these risks, the following security controls are recommended:

- **Implement the principle of least privilege:** Restrict access to the database server based on employee roles to minimize potential insider threats.
- **Apply defense in depth:** Use layered security measures, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and multi-factor authentication, to protect the server from unauthorized access.
- **Regular security training:** Educate employees on security best practices to reduce the likelihood of human error.

## Conclusion

By addressing the identified vulnerabilities through these remediation strategies, the company can significantly reduce the risk of a security breach. Implementing these controls will help protect the company's assets and ensure the continued confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data.
